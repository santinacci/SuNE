## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Lionel Santinacci received a Ph.D. from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL) in 2002. His thesis has been carried out successively at EPFL (1998-2000) and Friedrich-Alexander-Universität-Erlangen-Nürnberg (2000-2002) under the supervision of Prof. Patrik Schmuki. His Ph.D. work involved the AFM-scratching induced surface electrochemical nanostructuring. During this time, he also performed surface modifications of III-V semiconductors by anodic processes (oxide and porous layers) in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada. He performed post-doctoral studies on Li-polymer batteries by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at Aix-Marseille University (2002-2003). In 2003, he joined the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Paris (ENSCP) as non-tenured assistant professor to investigate the localized corrosion of Cu single crystal by in situ AFM (2003-2004). In 2004, he got a CNRS researcher position at the Lavoisier's Institute of the University of Versailles to continue the work on the anodic surface structuring of III-V materials such as InP in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte. The porous layers exhibiting modified physical properties have been grown and characterized by electrochemical and optical methods.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/santinacci/sune/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
